$npm install
- problem is that TFJS is compiled for N-API 5, and electron node is expecting 4
(or something like this)

$node_modules/.bin/electron-rebuild
- problem is no support for n-api-version in electron rebuild?

* Change node version to exactly match electron version
- problem is now canvas is one version too early or something ridiculous
- can't electron-rebuild b/c of previous error
- have to 
$node_modules/.bin/electron-rebuild -o canvas

Now sort of works
But this is difficult - help

(Also tried: https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/using-native-node-modules.md)
"Using npm"
but this didn't actually seeem to fix the problem
